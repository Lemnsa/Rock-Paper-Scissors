## What was Implemented ?
### High Order functions
These are functions which within them we have other functions.

### Javascript conditions
<li>if else</li>
<li>else if</li>

### Math.random() and Math.floor
The Math.random() returns a random number(float) between 0 and 1.
Math.floor() rounds down this number to the nearest whole number.

### Ternary Operator
This is a short way to write a long ####if else statement
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

### For Loop
This loop executes a condition until a particular number of specified times.
