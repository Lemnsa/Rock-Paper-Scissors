# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock paper scissors game exercise from The Odin Project.

## What was Implemented ?
### High Order functions
These are functions which within them we have other functions.

### Javascript conditions
<li>if else</li>
<li>else if</li>

### Math.random() and Math.floor
The Math.random() returns a random number(float) between 0 and 1.
Math.floor() rounds down this number to the nearest whole number.

### DOM (document Oject Model)
Helps us to manipulate html elements on the page, updating the UI based on particular constraints.

### Git branching
This is a technique used to separate the branch containing the old product from the new features 
to be added. This helps the developer from messing up the original product with not-ready features.
<li>You can share this branch to other developers for help or contribution.</li>
After everything is set, you can then merge the branch to main one.
The temporal branch can be deleted now.
